In an attempt to create a clear definition of all the functions of the application we are ordered to program, we conduct several steps of requirement analysis:


## Studying User's needs

#### First Customer's Meeting
* Interview
* Questionaries

#### Group Observation
* Review the meeting in timeline manner
* Dig more detail
* Prepare for the next meeting

#### Second Customer's Meeting
* Clear up the key function of the application
* More questionaries

#### Prototyping
* Draft Use case Diagram
* User story without point calculated

## Requirement Validation

#### Third Meeting
* we present the requirement in the form of user story and use case diagram.
* Clear up the mis-understanding/mis-assumption

#### Reflection:
* The assumption about the length of any activity
* The misunderstanding about...

## Results

#### Descriptions of the functionality of the application in UML Use case diagrams
*Insert the Case diagram here*

#### Descriptions of the understanding of the user perspective in (Epic) user stories
*Insert picture of Zenhub's backlog here*
