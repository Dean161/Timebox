In an attempt to create a clear definition of all the functions of the application we are ordered to program, we conduct several steps of requirement analysis:


## Studying User's needs

### First Customer's Meeting

### Group Observation

### Second Customer's Meeting

### Prototyping


## Requirement Validation

### Third Meeting: we present the requirement in the form of user story and use case diagram.
Clear up the mis-understanding/mis-assumption

## Results

### Descriptions of the functionality of the application in UML Use case diagrams

### Descriptions of the understanding of the user perspective in (Epic) user stories
