## Testing Process

Testing is an integral part of any Software Development process. Testing helps the developers to identify bugs/defects and fix them.
The different types of test methods are:
* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* Functional Testing
* System Testing
* Acceptance Testing

Test methods can be further classified into 
* White-Box Testing: Testing performed with the knowledge of internal code.
* Black-Box Testing: Testing performed without the knowledge of internal code.

**Unit Testing:** Each team member has tested and fixed all defects arising from their individual unit component. White-Box testing method was used for this testing. `Example: Login Screen`

**Integration Testing:** Each individual unit component was integrated with other unit components and tested. White-Box and Black-Box testing methods were used for this testing. `Example: Enabling the PIN from Settings Screen and validating the user defined PIN in Login Screen.`

**Functional Testing:** All the functional requirements provided by the user were tested. Black-Box testing method was used for this testing. `Example: As a user, I want to log activities.`

**System Testing:** The code was tested in different environments/systems. Black-Box testing method was used for this testing. `Example: App tested on devices running Android Oreo and Android Nougat.`

**Acceptance Testing:** The App was shown to the customer and tested for every requirement provided by him. Black-Box testing method was used for this testing. 

All the bugs are entered into Zenhub for tracking. The testing efforts are also kept in a Spreadsheet in team dropbox for easier access.
