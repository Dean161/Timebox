<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The project we have selected to work on is 'Activity Monitoring'. Time management is a key aspect for every student. Developing an app which could help every student to monitor their progress in studies, project/thesis work, exercise and leisure will help them to use their time efficiently. </p>
