Welcome to our blog!!We have successfully made it to the end of the course "Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers". In this blog, we would like to put forth our reflections on the whole experience of developing an android app, while working in a team. 

## Technical challenges our team encountered

We were a team with members, who were from different technical backgrounds. While this bought diversity to our team, we also faced some issues:

* Some of the team members had no prior experience in programming and this was a major setback in our team. However, with the support of other team members, also the team members with minor programming experiences have been able to contribute significantly to our project.

* Since none of the team members had worked on an android app earlier, getting the database running was considerably difficult. However, thanks to the continuous commitment and mutual support, we have been able to solve this task, which was of vital significance for a working app.


## Challenges and benefits we experienced as a team

As most of our team members had worked with each other on other projects, we did not face any problem as a team. However, having members with different level of programming experience and with different amount of available time for the project were issues we faced. Tasks have been split accordingly and due to good organization and real teamwork, we were able to succeed.

We did gain a lot of benefits throughout this whole journey, while having fun with our friends

* It helped us in managing our time more efficiently. Along with the development of the app, each blog and presentations had a speicifc deadline and by wisely managing our time we delivered the best we could.  

* We learnt how to organise a team, which contributes to the same code by dividing our tasks in a more structured and systematic method.  

* By using agile project management method, we have learnt to work in a well-organized and competent way. 
   
* More importantly, It allowed us to understand how people with different ideas and different culture of working can come together and work as one team through effective communication and adherence. 


## About the course
The course as expected, was a great platform to have hands on experience in developing an android app and learning some project management skills. It was a more effective learning approach, due to practical application of the lectures content. 
It has helped us in 

* Gaining additional programming skills

* Learning how an entire software engineering project,staring from requirements analysis untill the testing of the product can look in reality 

* Learning and applying agile software project management with SCRUM 

* Knowing how the interactions with the customer can take place, and how we need to understand and adapt to customer's needs.

   
#### We would like to thank Dr. Schulze for affording us with the oppurtunity to learn in such a practical way. He brought out the best in us by his regular feedbacks, continuous support and commitment to sharing his knowledge.
