Welcome to our blog!! 

We have successfully made it to the end of the course "Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers". In this blog, we would like to put forth our reflections on the whole experience of developing an android app, while working in a team. 

## Technical challenges our team encountered

* Some of the team members had no prior experience in programming and this was a major setback in our team. However, with the support of other team members, we were able to overcome this problem. 

* Since none of the team members had worked on an android app earlier, getting the database running was considerably difficult.  

## Challenges and benefits we experienced as a team

As most of our team members had worked with each other on other projects, we did not face any problem as a team. However, having a team with different level of programming experience was an issue we faced as a team. In this case, the ones with sufficient knowledge had to do more difficult tasks when compared to others.   

We did gain a lot of benefits throughout this whole journey:

* We made sure we met regularly, atleast once a week apart from the customer meetings. This helped us to have a clear and concrete goal for each sprint. 

* We met beforehand and practised for our presentations. Team members provided feedback to improve. 

* We supported and appreciated our team members, when they skilfully executed their tasks. 

* We did learn a lot, while having fun with our friends!! 


## About the course
The course as expected, was a great platform to have hands on experience in developing an android app and learning some project management skills. It was a more effective learning approach, due to practical application of the lectures content. 
It has helped us in 

* Gaining additional programming skills
* Learning and applying software development project management techniques
* Learning how a software engineering project can look in reality
* Working in a well-organized and competent way.
* Improving our presentation skills and writing skills through blogs 
* Efficiently work as a team
* Knowing how the interactions with the customer can take place, and how we need to adapt to customer's needs.  

#### We would like to thank Dr. Schulze for affording us with the oppurtunity to learn in such a practical way. He bought the best in us by his continuous support and commitment.
