<p>Welcome to our team’s blog. In this blog post we will introduce our Team, Project and our motivations to take up the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers”.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The project we have selected to work on is 'Activity Monitoring'. Time management is a key aspect for every student. Developing an app which could help every student to monitor their progress in studies, project/thesis work, exercise and leisure will help them to use their time efficiently. </p>

It also helps me to relate the concepts to my previous work experience and obtain better understanding of the processes.</a></td>

I believe that the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers" is a great opportunity not only to learn coding and develop an android app but also to learn the Project management skills required for any software engineer.</a></td>
    <td width="500" vertical-align="top"><img src="https://github.com/DBSE-teaching/isee2018-CurryWurst/blob/master/docs/images/Male.jpg" alt="Moritz_Photo" width="200" height="200"><br><b>Moritz Spiller</b><br><a>I think, the principles of software engineering and requirement engineering are crucial skills for everybody who wants to work in a software engineering field. I am eager to learn a profound approach to develop software in a team. In my opinion, I will also benefit more from a lecture which requires ongoing commitment, than I would from one where there is only an exam in the end of the semester. Furthermore, I would like to learn how to program my own apps, so it's even better that I can combine this with my curriculum by attending this course.</a></td>
