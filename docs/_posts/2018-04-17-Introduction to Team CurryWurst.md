<p>Welcome to our team’s blog. In this blog post we will introduce our Team, Project and our motivations to take up the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers”.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The project we have selected to work on is 'Activity Monitoring'. Time management is a key aspect for every student. Developing an app which could help every student to monitor their progress in studies, project/thesis work, exercise and leisure will help them to use their time efficiently. </p>

It also helps me to relate the concepts to my previous work experience and obtain better understanding of the processes.</a></td>

I believe that the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers" is a great opportunity not only to learn coding and develop an android app but also to learn the Project management skills required for any software engineer.</a></td>

I am eager to learn a profound approach to develop software in a team. In my opinion, I will also benefit more from a lecture which requires ongoing commitment, than I would from one where there is only an exam in the end of the semester. Furthermore, I would like to learn how to program my own apps, so it's even better that I can combine this with my curriculum by attending this course.</a></td>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p> Team work always brings uncertainty. May it be with respect to skills or in collaborating with the team members. As a team, we have planned to share each task between two team members. This will enable us to work seamlessly even if one of the team members is unable to deliver. </p>
