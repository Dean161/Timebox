## Coding Conventions

## Context of use
In order to identify the major needs and expectations of our users and, thereby, define the key functionalities of our app, we have created two different personas which represent the major user groups for our software application. 
The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your key audience segments for
reference and our approach to obtain personas, from which we can extract as much meaningful information as possible, was to ask us the following questions:
* What is the highest level of education this person has received?
* How much work experience does our person have?
* What is our personâ€™s professional background?
* Why will they use our application?
* When and where will they use our application?
* What are his/ her needs?

There are some more questions which are related to creating a good persona, like which gender and age does our person have or which technical devices does our person use on a regular basis. Since the answer to those questions do not influence our key audience segment in their usage of our app, we let them unanswered in the following created personas:  <br>
