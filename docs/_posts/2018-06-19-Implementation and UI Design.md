## Context of use
In order to identify the major needs and expectations of our users and, thereby, define the key functionalities of our app, we have created two different personas which represent the major user groups for our software application. 
The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your key audience segments for
reference and our approach to obtain personas, from which we can extract as much meaningful information as possible, was to ask us the following questions:
* What is the highest level of education this person has received?
* How much work experience does our person have?
* What is our personâ€™s professional background?
* Why will they use our application?
* When and where will they use our application?
* What are his/ her needs?

There are some more questions which are related to creating a good persona, like which gender and age does our person have or which technical devices does our person use on a regular basis. Since the answer to those questions do not influence our key audience segment in their usage of our app, we let them unanswered in the following created personas:  <br>

## Design Solutions

## Summary of Changes
In comparision with the initial design, we have made few changes to the user interface.
We started with a simple design for logging/scheduling an activity, which allowed the user to 
enter the dates and time manually.After the lecture on "User interface design" we understood the importance of having a 
UI which will satisfy certain functional,psychological and aesthetic criteria.we also want to ensure that we 
do not get unexpected user input, which is enforced by using UI elements such as Date and Time Pickers.

Another key change in our app is on the review page, where we show a graphical representation of all activities.Our first design showed 
filter options based on either start & end date or categories which was not practically correct. However, after clarifying with the customer we are designing a review screen where the user can choose start & end date and select few or all categories.
The graph will display the percentage of categories for selected time period.
