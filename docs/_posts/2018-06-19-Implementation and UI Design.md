## Coding Conventions
Coding conventions improve the readability of the code. Therefore it is very important for us to adhere to some standard coding conventions. This project is in line with the standards provided in the **Google Java Style Guide**.

**1. Java file names**

All the class and interface files must end with `.java` extension and have only one class.

**2. Source file structure**

All the source files should have:
* License or copyright message
* Package name
* Import statements (Android statements, third party statements, java/javax statements)
* One high level class
* Overrides of methods

**3. Comments**

All the source files must have comments for each section.

**4. Variable declarations**

Every variable declaration should have only one variable.

**5. Annotations**

Every annotation must appear right after the comment block and before the corresponding class or method. There should be only one annotation per line.

**6. Naming Conventions**

* Java Classes/Interfaces: `UpperCamelCase.java`
* Activity Java Files: `UpperCamelCaseActivity.java`
* Activity Layout Files: `activity_lowercase_name.xml`
* Fragment Files: `fragment_lowercase_name.xml`
* Menu Files: `menu_lowercase_name.xml`
* Method Names: `lowerCamelCase`
* Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
* Variables: `lowercase_name`

**7.Miscellaneous**

* All strings should be used from the strings.xml file using `R.string.string_name`.
* All colors should be used from colors.xml or android/colors using `R.colors.colorsName` or `android.R.colors.colorName`.

## Context of use
In order to identify the major needs and expectations of our users and, thereby, define the key functionalities of our app, we have created two different personas which represent the major user groups for our software application. 
The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your key audience segments for
reference and our approach to obtain personas, from which we can extract as much meaningful information as possible, was to ask us the following questions:
* What is the highest level of education this person has received?
* How much work experience does our person have?
* What is our person’s professional background?
* Why will they use our application?
* When and where will they use our application?
* What are his/ her needs?

There are some more questions which are related to creating a good persona, like which gender and age does our person have or which technical devices does our person use on a regular basis. Since the answer to those questions do not influence our key audience segment in their usage of our app, we let them unanswered in the following created personas:  <br>
