 	<h1>Software Engineers Blog -- Summer Term 2018</h1>
 	<p>Along with the lecture "Introduction to Software
   Engineering for Engineers" at Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg, our team "CurryWurst" will host a blog here. We will use it to
   document the progress in our project, which is about developing an "Activity Monitor" for Android operating systems. 
   Have fun, accompanying our team during this semester.</p>
